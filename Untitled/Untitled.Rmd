abstract: >
   The \pkg{regsem} package in R, an implementation of regularized structural equation modeling [RegSEM; @jacobucci2016regularized], was recently developed with the goal of incorporating various forms of penalized likelihood estimation in a broad array of structural equations models. The forms of regularization include both the \textit{ridge} [@hoerl1970] and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [\textit{lasso}; @Tibshirani1996], along with sparser extensions. RegSEM is particularly useful for structural equation models that have a small parameter to sample size ratio, as the addition of penalties can reduce the complexity, thus reducing the bias of the parameter estimates. The paper covers the algorithmic details and an overview of the use of \pkg{regsem} with the application of both factor analysis and latent growth curve models.
